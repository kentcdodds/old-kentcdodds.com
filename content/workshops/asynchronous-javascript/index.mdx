### Get up to speed with JavaScript’s built-in APIs and syntax for asynchronous programming

One of JavaScript’s strengths is what’s called the “event loop.” This one
language architectural element forms a lot about how you program and interact
with JavaScript in your day-to-day. In recent years JavaScript has made leaps
and bounds in the built-in standard library and syntax to allow for better
asynchronous patterns.

In this workshop, we’ll take a deep dive into the two most commonly used
asynchronous patterns: The Promises API and async/await syntax. We’ll see how
these two relate to one another and you’ll leave with a strong understanding of
how async code works in JavaScript with these patterns.

## Topics

- Understanding JavaScript’s Event Loop
- Callbacks
- Promises (very deep dive)
- async/await
