# KCD Office Hours

Twice a week, Kent will be available for an hour to answer any questions you
have. This is especially helpful for [KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs) but everyone
is invited. Office hours is held on Zoom (you need to be logged into your Zoom
account to join).

To join, simply join the [KCD Discord](/discord) community, and jump in the
`#🏫-office-hours` channel to ask questions and get the links that I share with
my responses.

Office Hours are held twice weekly:

- Mondays at
  [9:30-10:30 AM Mountain Time](<https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9%3A30%20am&tz=Mountain%20Time%20(MT)&>).
