# KCD Office Hours

Twice a week, Kent will be available for an hour to answer any questions you
have. This is especially helpful for [KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs) but everyone
is invited. Office hours is held on Zoom (you need to be logged into your Zoom
account to join).

To join, simply join the [KCD Discord](/discord) community, and jump in the
"#🏫-office-hours" channel to ask questions and get the links that I share with
my responses.
