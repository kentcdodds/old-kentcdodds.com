### To learn the more advanced React hooks and different patterns to enable great developer APIs for custom hooks.

React’s basic built-in hooks are phenomenally good and there are several more
advanced hooks that provide us with terrific opportunities for optimization. The
hooks feature itself also opens up a world of new possibilities to simplify
application code through the use of highly optimized and useful custom hooks.

In this workshop, we’ll look at some of the more advanced hooks and ways they
can be used to optimize your components and custom hooks. We’ll also look at
several patterns you can follow to make custom hooks that provide great APIs for
developers to be productive building applications.

## Topics

- Optimize expensive operations with useMemo and useCallback
- Interact with third party DOM libraries with useLayoutEffect
- Learn when to use (and when not to use) useImperativeHandle and useDebugValue
- Create custom hooks for complex use cases using patterns like prop getters and
  even hooks that create other components
